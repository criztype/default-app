SlimFit
===========

A simple mvc based PHP skeleton framework.

Currently there some parts based on the Zend Framework version 1.12 (http://framework.zend.com/) and 
the php-router by Rob Apodaca (http://robap.github.com/php-router/).

Some parts are currently under construction and not quite well formatted.
